# **PetStore API Automation Framework**

A project I built to prove that **test automation is software engineering**, not just scripting and writing code. 
This framework captures real-world API behavior, not textbook REST expectations, using a **SOLID-driven**, maintainable structure that scales gracefully.

---

##  **1. Overview**

This project is a clean, intentionally structured API automation framework built for the **Swagger PetStore API**.


It’s built with:
- **Clean architecture**
- **SOLID principles**
- **Predictable test behaviours**
- **Real world API validation**
- **Maintainability over shortcuts**


---

## **2. Architecture & Approach**

### **Why this structure**
Because good automation code should feel like production code.  
A framework must be readable, extendable, and predictable.

### **Why this stack**
- **Java 21** – stable, expressive, modern syntax  
- **TestNG** – mature, flexible orchestration  
- **Rest Assured** – clean, fluent API calls  
- **Jackson** – reliable JSON   
- **Allure** – elegant, developer-centric reporting  
- **Maven** – lifecycle + dependency management  

### **Why SOLID**
These principles are important to follw. they are the reason this framework won’t collapse as it grows:
SOLID Principle:
- **SRP** - each class does one thing well
- **OCP** - new endpoints don’t require rewriting old code
- **LSP** - models/gateways can be swapped or mocked
- **ISP** - no bloated interfaces
- **DIP** - tests depend on abstractions, not implementations
This keeps the framework stable even as it grows.
 

That’s how the framework stays **stable and extensible** beyond the demo stage.

 │         │         ├── foundation      → Base setup, environment loader, reusable assertions
 │         │         ├── petclient       → API gateway (CRUD operations)
 │         │         ├── petmodels       → Domain models aligned with Swagger schema

 │         │         └── testsuite       → Positive, negative, and edge-case tests
 │         └── resources
 │              └── test-environment.properties → Base URI configuration
 ├── allure-report/   → Static HTML report for the full execution
 ├── pom.xml          → Maven configuration
 └── .gitignore       → Clean repo


Every piece has a defined purpose — no disposable code.

## **4. Test Coverage**

###  Positive Flow
- Create → Retrieve → Update → Delete → Verify Lifecycle  

### Negative & Edge Cases
The PetStore API… isn’t perfect. Instead of hiding that, my framework captures it.

| **Scenario**        | **Expected REST** | **Actual API** | **Framework Expectation** |
|----------------------|------------------:|---------------:|--------------------------:|
| **Non existing ID**  | 404               | 404             |  404 handled gracefully |
| **Negative ID**      | 400 / 404         | 404             |  treated as 404         |
| **Empty JSON `{}`**  | 400               | 200             |  handled as 200         |
| **Missing fields**   | 400               | 200             |  handled as 200         |
| **Invalid payload**  | 400               | 200             |  handled as 200         |

## 🏁 Getting Started
bash
git clone https: https://github.com/Artidk/Arti_Mohrir_task.git
cd petstore-api-automation
mvn clean install


## **5. Setup**

### **You’ll need:**
- Java 21  
- Maven  
- Any modern IDE (I use IntelliJ)  

### **Install dependencies**
 bash
mvn clean install
Environment config

src/test/resources/test-environment.properties

base.uri=https://petstore.swagger.io/v2
---

## **6. Running Tests**

To run everything:

mvn test
allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
allure-report/index.html

View report
Open:
allure-report/index.html
(Use Firefox for local viewing — Chrome/Edge block local JS.)
 ---
 
## **7. Allure Execution Report**
You’ll find the generated static report in:
 allure-report/
It contains:
- Overview
- Suites
-	Behaviors
- Timeline
- Graphs
- Attachments
This is the exact report generated from the final execution.

  ## **8. Key Design Choices**

 1. Gateway pattern-
All HTTP logic lives in PetGateway.
Test classes stay business-focused and readable.

2. Data factory-
PetBlueprint dynamically creates valid/invalid payloads.
Tests stay DRY, expressive, and maintainable.

3. Reusable assertions-
Consistent validation logic, centralized and extendable.

4. Readable tests-
Each test reads like behavior documentation, not just checks.

5. Real-world behavior-
This framework doesn’t fake the API’s oddities — it reflects them.

 ## **9. What This Project Demonstrates**
 - I design for clarity
 - I build frameworks that scale with SOLID principle
 - I document real behaviours and not assumptions
 - I write tests that are readable, predictable, and maintainable
 - I understand CI principles and build frameworks that integrate cleanly

 ---
 
 ## **10. CI Stack Used **

 Even though this project does not include a full CI pipeline file, the framework is CI ready and built with CI principles in mind.
  CI Concepts Applied
•	Tests run headlessly with Maven
•	No UI dependencies
•	No environment coupling
•	Deterministic test data
•	Clean exit codes for pipeline integration
•	Allure results generated in a CI friendly format
 
CI Tools This Framework Can Plug Into
•	GitHub Actions
•	Git
